# README

This is a CRUD application done by Rails 6.
Idea is that user can:
-post article,
-edit article and
-delete article.
Also app has an authentication system, so that user can sign up and login after that.
For styling I have used CSS and Bootstrap 4.

Things that I have covered:

* CRUD actions

* Authentication system

* Database relations(one to many and many to many associations)
